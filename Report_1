CSE 280 Team Swap Progress Report #1 (Friday, Feb 15 2019)

Progress overall (What was accomplished this past week):
  Created project management docs, including API Endpoint, Project Overview, Project Milestone, and Individual Progress 
  Researched on Ajax calls and CSE 216 codes that might help our project

Problems (What were we unable to complete):
  We should have already started writing the code. There was a lack of communication and plans for the team and every team members. 

Goals for next week:
  Finish Milestone Document
  Set up a backend 
  Set up a server
  Establish communication between backend and frontend 
  Be able to open web page 
  Be able to view/post items

Potential Issues:
  Start is hard; we should have everyone working on codes ASAP
  If backend is not working, the other parts of our project won’t be able to communicate and work as a whole
  The learning curve of trying to learn new code if we don’t reuse old code (The upside is that we will understand the code much better)
